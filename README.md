# Vite+ Monorepo Starter

A starter for creating a Vite+ monorepo, with `apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`, and
`packages/utils`. `apps/backend` is a runtime-agnostic Hono API, run on Cloudflare Workers by
`apps/backend-worker` or as a standalone Node.js server by `apps/backend-node` (a project keeps
one of the two). `apps/frontend` is a Vue 3 + Vuetify 4 client that talks to it through Hono RPC
(typed request/response, no hand-shared types package), and `packages/utils` holds
runtime-agnostic code shared by both.

## Setting Up a New Project

This repo is a template. To start a new project from it:

1. Clone it under the new project's name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kouki-miura2/fullstack-typescript.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project
```

2. Point it at the new project's own remote instead of this template's:

macOS / Linux (or Git Bash on Windows):

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin <new-project-repo-url>
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
git init
git remote add origin <new-project-repo-url>
```

3. Choose the backend runtime and delete the other one. Routes and business logic live in
   `apps/backend` either way; only the entrypoint package differs.

**Cloudflare Workers** — delete `apps/backend-node`:

```bash
rm -rf apps/backend-node                          # PowerShell: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force apps/backend-node
```

- Root `AGENTS.md` — remove the `apps/backend-node` line
- `README.md` — remove the `apps/backend-node` section (this file)

**Node.js** — delete `apps/backend-worker`:

```bash
rm -rf apps/backend-worker                        # PowerShell: Remove-Item -Recurse -Force apps/backend-worker
```

- `.claude/agents/cloudflare-deployer.md` — delete (Workers-only deploy agent)
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — remove `workerd: true` from `allowBuilds`
- Root `package.json` — change `dev-b` to `vp run backend-node#dev`
- Root `AGENTS.md` — remove the `apps/backend-worker` line
- `README.md` — remove the `apps/backend-worker` section (this file)

Then update the lockfile and check nothing still refers to the deleted runtime:

```bash
vp install
git grep -n -i -e backend-node -- ':!README.md' ':!.claude/skills/check-secrets' ':!.claude/agents/web-security-auditor.md'                          # kept Cloudflare Workers
git grep -n -i -e backend-worker -e wrangler -e workerd -- ':!README.md' ':!.claude/skills/check-secrets' ':!.claude/agents/web-security-auditor.md' # kept Node.js
```

(`.claude/skills/check-secrets` and `.claude/agents/web-security-auditor.md` cover both runtimes conditionally, so they stay either way.)

4. Rename the project and set its time zone:

- Root `package.json` — `name`
- `packages/utils/src/date/zone.ts` — `TIME_ZONE_OFFSET_MINUTES` if the app's time zone isn't JST (UTC+9)
- `apps/frontend/.env` — `VITE_APP_TITLE` (browser tab title and app bar)
- `apps/backend-worker/wrangler.jsonc` — `name` if you kept Cloudflare Workers (the Worker's name; must be unique per account, or deploys overwrite each other)
- `README.md` — title and description (this file)

Then check nothing still refers to the template:

```bash
git grep -n -i fullstack-typescript -- ':!README.md'
```

5. Install dependencies and confirm everything works:

```bash
vp install
vp run ready
```

6. Commit the result and push to the new remote:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: initial commit from fullstack-typescript template"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Development

The frontend is served at `/` and the API at `/api` on the same origin, in development and in
production. Run both dev servers and open the frontend's URL; it proxies `/api` to the backend
(`localhost:8787`):

```bash
vp run dev-b   # backend
vp run dev-f   # frontend
```

In production, the backend runtime serves both: the Worker (`apps/backend-worker`) serves the
frontend build as static assets, and the Node.js server (`apps/backend-node`) serves it with
`serveStatic`. Both list `frontend` as a workspace dependency, so `vp run -r build` (or `-t` for
one package) builds the frontend once, before them; the Worker's `deploy` builds it itself.

- Check everything is ready:

```bash
vp run ready
```

- Run all tests:

```bash
vp run -r test
```

- Build everything:

```bash
vp run -r build
```

## packages/utils

- Run format/lint/type checks:

```bash
vp run utils#check
```

- Run the tests:

```bash
vp run utils#test
```

## apps/backend

Runtime-agnostic routes and business logic. Run it through `apps/backend-worker` or `apps/backend-node`.

- Run format/lint/type checks:

```bash
vp run backend#check
```

- Run the tests:

```bash
vp run backend#test
```

## apps/backend-worker

Runs `apps/backend` on Cloudflare Workers.

- Debug locally (reloads on changes in `apps/backend` too):

```bash
vp run backend-worker#dev
```

- Build (frontend + dry-run Worker bundle):

```bash
vp run -t backend-worker#build
```

- Deploy (frontend + API, one Worker):

```bash
vp run backend-worker#deploy
```

- Regenerate Workers binding types:

```bash
vp run backend-worker#cf-typegen
```

## apps/backend-node

Runs `apps/backend` as a standalone Node.js server.

- Debug locally (reloads on changes in `apps/backend` too):

```bash
vp run backend-node#dev
```

- Build (frontend + server bundle):

```bash
vp run -t backend-node#build
```

- Run the built bundle (frontend at `/`, API at `/api`, port from `PORT`):

```bash
vp run backend-node#start
```

## apps/frontend

- Run format/lint/type checks:

```bash
vp run frontend#check
```

- Run the tests:

```bash
vp run frontend#test
```

- Run the dev server:

```bash
vp run frontend#dev
```

- Build:

```bash
vp run frontend#build
```

- Preview the production build:

```bash
vp run frontend#preview
```
